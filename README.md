# Analyzes-of-Apps-Stores-and-Google_Play-Market
My goal for this project is to analyze data to help understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.
This involves collecting two types of data:

1.A data set containing data about approximately ten thousand Android apps from Google Play which I have named Google_data— the data was collected in August 2018 

2.A data set containing data about approximately seven thousand iOS apps from the App Store which I have named Apple_data— the data was collected in July 2017
We'll start by opening and exploring these two data sets. To make it easier for me to explore them, I will create a function named explore_data() to use repeatedly to print rows in a more readable way.
